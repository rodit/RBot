RBot
===
RBot is a fully scriptable bot for AQW based on C# created by [Rodit](https://github.com/rodit/RBot) and updated by me.
The main focus is to provide an abrangent platform for creation of complex script chains with efficiency.
The documentation can be [found here](https://brenohenrike.github.io/Scripts/), and the best example of those efficient script chains can be [found here](https://brenohenrike.github.io/Scripts/).
